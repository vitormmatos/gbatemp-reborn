### What is GBATemp?

I'm quite surprised you got here without knowing what is GBATemp.  
GBATemp is a videogame forum that dates back 2002.  
Initially it was used as a small Gameboy Advance ROM site.  
Due to it's piracy nature, hosting it was complicated,  
broken links happened often and therefore it was almost a _temporary_ gba roms page.  
That's how it started: GBATemp

Now it has become a forum center for videogame news and discussions

### What is GBATemp Reborn

GBATemp Reborn is a project to recreate the known and loved GBATemp from ground zero. The goal is to create a modern, lightweight and elegant forum, that fit all devices, that eventually will substitute the original GBATemp.
